Choosing the most useful feature extraction function depends heavily on the specific application and the type of audio you're dealing with.

Time-domain features:
Root Mean Square (RMS) energy: Captures overall loudness of the audio. Useful for differentiating quiet vs. loud segments.
Zero-crossing rate: Measures how frequently the audio signal crosses the zero amplitude line. Helpful for identifying percussive sounds.
MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients): Represent the perceived spectral content of the audio. Good for capturing timbre and overall sound character.

Frequency-domain features:
Spectral centroid: Indicates the center of mass of the spectral energy distribution. Useful for comparing brightness or darkness of tones.
Spectral flux: Measures the change in spectral content over time. Useful for identifying transitions and dynamic sections.
Chroma features: Represent the distribution of energy across 12 pitch classes. Helpful for comparing tonal characteristics and chord progressions.
Spectral contrast: Compares the spectral energy distribution in different frequency bands. Useful for differentiating instruments and textures.

Additional features:
Tempo: grouping music by speed.
Rhythm features: Measures like onset detection and tempo variability can aid in comparing rhythmic patterns.
Timbre features: Techniques like mel spectrograms or log-mel spectrograms offer more detailed representations of sound texture.

Experimentation and combination:
No single feature is perfect for all scenarios. Experiment with different options and see how they perform on your specific dataset. Combining multiple features often leads to better results, as different features capture different aspects of the audio information.

Additional Considerations:
Consider the computational cost of extracting each feature. Some features are more expensive to calculate than others.
Preprocess your audio data before feature extraction to remove noise or unwanted components.
Normalize your features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
Evaluate the performance of your chosen features on a held-out validation set to ensure they are actually capturing meaningful similarities.
